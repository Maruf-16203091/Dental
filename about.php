<b>Director's Message:</b><br>
The magnificently designed ALHAZZ CHANDUGAJI SCHOOL stands proudly on the Dhaka-Mymensing Road in the heart of Tongi. 
It is about five km from the zooming Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport offering an impressive and eye catching view to the onlookers.
 It accommodates about 500 students in one shifts.

In an era of information and communication technology, due emphasis should be given on imparting knowledge on information technology along 
with high standard general education in order to make our students worthy citizens of the present high tech world.

In addition, the college is on the verge of thorough digitization. The college accounts, library, admission procedure, compilation of results
 and preparation of students' progress report are going to be digitized. This will ensure easy access to required information and bring about 
 a greater degree of transparency and accountability in overall administration of the college.
